"""Context compression — extract the AIAgent methods that drive summarisation.

Three concerns live here:

* :func:`check_compression_model_feasibility` — startup probe of the
  configured auxiliary compression model.  Warns when the aux context
  window can't fit the main model's compression threshold; auto-lowers
  the session threshold when possible; hard-rejects auxes below
  ``MINIMUM_CONTEXT_LENGTH``.

* :func:`replay_compression_warning` — re-emit a stored warning through
  the gateway ``status_callback`` once it's wired up (the callback is
  set after :class:`AIAgent` construction).

* :func:`compress_context` — the actual compression call.  Runs the
  configured compressor, splits the SQLite session, rotates the
  session_id, notifies plugin context engines / memory providers, and
  returns the compressed message list and active system prompt.

* :func:`try_shrink_image_parts_in_messages` — image-too-large recovery
  helper that re-encodes ``data:image/...;base64,...`` parts at a smaller
  size so retries can fit under provider ceilings (Anthropic's 5 MB).

``run_agent`` keeps thin wrappers for each so existing call sites
(``self._compress_context(...)``) keep working.  Tests that exercise
these paths see no behavioural change.

Thread-safety contract for extension points (#76354 review)
------------------------------------------------------------

When the host-level progress-aware timeout is enabled (the default:
``compression.context_timeout_seconds > 0``), the WHOLE compression pass —
including plugin/legacy **context engines** (``compress()`` /
``on_session_start`` / boundary callbacks) and **memory providers**
(``on_pre_compress`` / ``on_session_switch``) — runs on a pooled daemon
thread, not the conversation thread. Extension authors must assume:

* Calls may arrive on an arbitrary pooled thread; do not rely on
  thread-affinity or ``threading.local`` state shared with the caller.
* The input message list is a private deep snapshot owned by the worker;
  engines MAY mutate it in place (legacy contract preserved), and that
  mutation is invisible to the live conversation unless the pass commits.
* Publication to caller-visible / durable state happens ONLY on an admitted
  commit (:class:`CompressionCommitFence`); after a host timeout the still-
  running engine's work is discarded.
* Two compression passes never run concurrently for one session (durable
  per-session lock), but passes for DIFFERENT sessions may run concurrently
  on pool siblings — engine/provider instances shared across sessions must
  be thread-safe or internally locked.

        durable/session state. The flag store is lock-free: a commit that is

          concurrent ``begin_commit`` cannot slip in between the check and
          the release (it would be refused anyway — the flag is already set).
        - acquire fails → the lock holder is either an in-flight commit or a
          transient boundary (lock-setup / cancel admission). Defer: the
          release then runs in ``finish_commit`` (after the mutation fully
          completes) or on the ``begin_commit``-refusal path, whichever the

    """Run ``worker(fence)`` under a sync progress-aware timeout.

    The idle budget is inactivity-based (same idea as gateway session hygiene):
    streamed summary progress via :meth:`CompressionCommitFence.touch_progress`
    extends the wait. A hard ceiling still bounds a degenerate trickle stream.

    When cancellation wins before the commit boundary, returns
    ``(messages, system_prompt_fallback)`` immediately and leaves the worker
    thread detached — the fence prevents a late commit from mutating session
    state. When the worker already entered the commit boundary, waits for that
    commit to finish and returns its result.

    Timeout budgets (``idle_timeout_seconds`` / ``total_ceiling_seconds``) cover
    the **pre-commit** wait only — the summary / stream phase before
    :meth:`CompressionCommitFence.begin_commit`. Once the worker holds the
    commit fence, SessionDB mutation is already in flight and cannot be safely
    abandoned without risking transcript divergence; the commit is therefore
    always allowed to complete. The commit-phase wait is still *bounded in
    increments* against the remaining total ceiling: if the commit runs past
    ``total_ceiling_seconds``, the overrun is logged loudly (escalating from
    WARNING to ERROR on repeat) and surfaced once via ``on_commit_overrun``,
    while the host keeps waiting in bounded slices until the commit finishes.
    The documented guarantee is: **summary phase bounded by the ceiling;
    commit phase logged + surfaced if it exceeds it** (never silently hung,
    never abandoned mid-commit).

    ``system_prompt_fallback`` may be a string or a zero-arg callable resolved
    only on the timeout path, so successful compression never pays for (or
    fails on) an eager prompt rebuild. ``on_timeout_cause`` receives whether
    the total ceiling expired and whether provider progress was observed before
    ``on_timeout`` runs, allowing hosts to report the timeout accurately while
    preserving the existing three-argument timeout callback contract.

    ``stall_fallback`` (default on) makes an aborted stall attempt the
    configured ``auxiliary.compression.fallback_chain`` once — pinned onto a
    fresh fence — before degrading to "continue without compression". Nothing
    raises out of a silent stall, so the auxiliary client's own fallback
    handling (exception-path only) never sees it (#78981). ``on_timeout``
    therefore fires only after that attempt has also failed, which keeps its
    cooldown bookkeeping from suppressing the retry it precedes.

    ``new_fence`` mints that retry's fence. Hosts that publish the active
    fence for hard-interrupt admission pass a factory that publishes the new
    one too, so a ``/stop`` during the retry serializes against the retry's
    commit boundary rather than the aborted attempt's.

            wedges the session. Unlike ``force`` it does not clear the

        commit_fence: Optional cooperative fence for executor callers that
