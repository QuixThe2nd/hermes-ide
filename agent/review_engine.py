"""Shared engine for the /review command — every surface calls this.

/review spawns an independent, full-privilege background subagent (the same
async delegation rail as ``delegate_agent(background=true)``) whose job is to
thoroughly review whatever the recent conversation presented: a PR, a diff,
code, documentation, or any other work product. The reviewer's result
re-enters the spawning session as a normal async-delegation completion, so
the primary agent sees the review and can act on it.

Model routing: the reviewer runs on ``auxiliary.review`` (provider/model/
base_url/api_key/api_mode in config.yaml) when configured; otherwise it
inherits the parent agent's credentials — main-model-first, same convention
as every other auxiliary task. Resolution reuses the delegation credential
resolver (``tools.delegate_tool._resolve_delegation_credentials``) via the
internal ``credentials_cfg`` parameter of ``delegate_agent`` so native-SDK
providers, api_mode detection, and credential pools all behave identically
to ``delegation.provider`` pins.

Surfaces (CLI ``/review``, gateway ``/review``, TUI/Desktop live dispatch)
are thin adapters: snapshot the conversation, call :func:`start_review`,
print the dispatch note.
